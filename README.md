## Where I get stuck or sidetracked

All individual contributors get "stuck" or sidetracked at some point. I don't see this as being particularly bad, but as Camille Fournier [points out](https://medium.com/@skamille/how-do-individual-contributors-get-stuck-63102ba43516#.ixz2u23ii), recognizing when people get stuck is a super power, because you can plan your projects around the relative weaknesses of different people on your team.

Here are some of the things I have observed about where I get sidetracked or stuck:

### Sidetracked

* I sometimes solve problems because they are interesting, even if they're not the most important thing to be working on. I have gotten a lot better at this, but there is still progress to be made. This used to manifest as working on interesting side-projects instead of my main deliverable, but these days I'm more prone to spend more time over-thinking core APIs and abstractions.
* Refactoring. I sometimes catch myself "weeding the garden" (_e.g._, moving header files around, refactoring interfaces, and so on) a bit too much.
* Testing. I believe tests are a good insurance policy to help you reason about the technical risks you're taking, but I'm a bit of a completionist, and sometimes spend a bit too much time on this.

### Stuck

* Sometimes I'll start to solve a problem, and then forget to periodically re-examine my goals to see if there's an easier way to accomplish my goals. This is related to the fact that I see one of my biggest strengths as persistence; so while this is sometimes a good quality, I haven't learned yet how to always tell the difference.
* I learn best when I have something I can interact with. Corollary: I do occasionally get stuck when I have to imagine how something works instead of being able to actually play with it and find out for sure. For example, I used to hack on the Linux kernel in my spare time, and the undocumented locking conditions of different subsystems plus the 5-8 minute compile times caused me a lot of anxiety about ever being able to figure stuff out, which subsequently caused me to spend more time on things than I could have.
* Procrastination is an anxiety disorder, and most people do it whe something is causing them anxiety. I am most anxious when I feel like I'm not trusted to carry out my job, so trust is at the center of how I process all work interactions. If I feel like I'm not trusted to do my job, I am very likely to start procrastinating.

## Things that make me grumpy

* People who are overly competitve with their peers. I feel that competition is best directed at external entities. If I feel like my team is actively trying to make promotions a competition, it makes it very high cost for me to interact with them.
* Managers managing at the task level instead of the goal level.
  * I am completely fine receiving feedback about the goal alignment of actions, but I tend to perform better when I feel mostly accountable for triaging and prioritizing work items, and communicating the status of those things to the team.
  * More specifically of my input is not taken seriously at the task- or goal-level, then I will start to wonder if I'm being used to my full potential.
* Not being consulted about things that directly affect my life. Everything from not giving clear feedback about how a project is going, to deciding what toolchain I need to use, _etc_.
